# React + Vite
 
## Features:

- Dynamic Book Listings: Utilize React to dynamically display a list of books available in your store. Users can browse through the catalog and view details such as book title, author, cover image, and description.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.



Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
