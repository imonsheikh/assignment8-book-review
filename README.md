## Features:

- Dynamic Book Listings: Utilize React to dynamically display a list of books available in your store. Users can browse through the catalog and view details such as book title, author, cover image, and description.This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

- Responsive Design: Ensure your book store website is responsive and optimized for different devices and screen sizes using React's responsive design techniques and CSS frameworks. This ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- Book Detail Pages: Create individual book detail pages using React Router to provide users with more information about each book, including synopsis, reviews, ratings, and related products. Users can click on a book to view its details without leaving the main page.

- Wishlist: Implement a wishlist or favorites feature using React state management to allow users to save books they're interested in for future reference. This encourages user engagement and helps users keep track of books they want to purchase later.

- Multiple Sorting Options: Offer users the ability to sort books by various criteria such as  publication year, rating, total pages. Providing multiple sorting options allows users to customize their browsing experience based on their preferences.
